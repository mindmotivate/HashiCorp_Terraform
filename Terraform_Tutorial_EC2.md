# Terraform Introduction


Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows you to define and manage your cloud infrastructure in a declarative manner. Terraform uses a simple, human-readable language called the HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) to define your infrastructure. With Terraform, you can create, modify, and destroy infrastructure resources across multiple cloud providers, including Amazon Web Services (AWS) 

In other words, its designed to make life easier for the average AWS Cloud Developer!

Terraform is useful because it allows you to manage your infrastructure as code, which means that you can version control your infrastructure changes, collaborate with other team members, and automate your infrastructure deployment process. Terraform also provides a consistent and repeatable way to create and manage your infrastructure resources, which helps to reduce errors and increase efficiency 

Terraform is highly compatible with AWS and provides a rich set of resources that allow you to manage your AWS infrastructure. You can use Terraform to create and manage a wide range of AWS resources, including EC2 instances, S3 buckets, RDS databases, VPCs, and more. 

Let's demonstrate the power of Terraform by creating a simple EC2 instance!
